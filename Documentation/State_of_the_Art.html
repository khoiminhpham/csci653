<h3><strong>Current State of the Art</strong>.</h3>

<p>Containerization on HPC environment is still relatively new and not fully supported.<br />
A few Containerization tool that works in HPC: Singularity, Shifter, CharlieCloud etc.<br />
Since Docker image can be converted to Singularity, I&#39;ll choose Singularity.<br />
Portability maybe limited, therefore, it&#39;d be nice if we can find a (parallel computing) program that can run on both environment.</p>

<p>Some other approaches include&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Deploy HPC services inside Docker Container<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Use DockerSwarm to replace HPC workload manager<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;etc.</p>
