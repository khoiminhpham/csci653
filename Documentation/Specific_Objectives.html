<strong>Step-by-step to the Goal:&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>1.&nbsp;First, we&#39;ll&nbsp;need to set up containerization environment on a super computer.<br />
2. Choose&nbsp;a program we&#39;ve seen in this class, such as image processing, or energies simulation, then add time execution measurements.&nbsp;<br />
3.&nbsp;Run it on HPC environment alone, and scale up the amount of recourses, until seeing no more improvement in running time.<br />
4. Install required library to run this program in the new container (probably mpich, and openMP). Run the program on this container as describe in step (3), keep all the parameters unchanged.<br />
5. Now we can compare the execution time between 2 test cases, the trade-off percentage is expected to be lower than 10%.</p>
