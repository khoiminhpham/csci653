<h3><strong>Techniques to be used</strong></h3>

<p>Regardless whether it&#39;s an HPC, a PC, a hardware virtual machine, or an OS virtual machine, the computational power&nbsp;can still be calculated using FLOPS.&nbsp;<br />
After receiving execution time in both test cases, given the same amount of Floating Point Operations (same program), the difference in FLOPS will be the trade-off&nbsp;in computational performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Also, since virtualization only happens in CPU, the program we choose shouldn&#39;t consist of GPU computation (MPI and openMP only)..<br />
