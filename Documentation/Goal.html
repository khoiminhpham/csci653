<p>1. Goal: What&rsquo;s the &ldquo;big&rdquo; problem? Why important? Statement of the problem: If you can &ldquo;clearly&rdquo; state the problem, it often automatically suggests a solution. What will be the contribution?</p>

<p>Within just the past few years, the use of containers has revolutionized the way in which industries and enterprises have developed and deployed computational software and distributed systems. The containerization model has gained traction within the HPC community as well with the promise of improved reliability, reproducibility, portability and levels of customization that were previously not possible on supercomputers.</p>

<p>Because Containerization is OS Virtulization, it&#39;s proved to be light weight and consume less energy/cumputational power compared to traditional Virtualization technique liek VMWare or Virtual-Box<br />
